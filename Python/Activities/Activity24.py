""" Parameterization
Using pytest:

Create a new test file and do the following:

Create a fixture named wallet() that initializes the variable 'amount' with 0
Create a test with the following parameters:
earned	spent	expected
30	10	20
20	2	18

Write a test that performs the following scenario with the parameters
    My wallet initially has 0,
    I add {earned} units of cash to the wallet,
    I spend {spent} units of cash, and
    I should have {expected} units of cash remaining after the two transactions.
